Notes - 
- all graphs, article titles, content, information is not accurate and only stands as a placeholder. I imagine much of the real info will be coming from APIs.
- As discussed with Claus, only the first article "animal husbandry" in the header drop down will forward to a new window with an article (all CSS was done in line to save time)
- added breakpoints for responsive site I coded the main site for 1400px wide and larger, anything below 1400px will work for (most) smaller screens. Additionally, I added one other breakpoint below 1200px width specifically for the navbar. Please note that on screens below 500px some of the items will shift. In a real site, we would have generally 3 or so breakpoints to deal with all contingencies. I only did two as per request.
- some icons may not match original site, I utilized what I could easily find.
- logo - I did not have access to your logo so the "logo" shown is just a placeholder.
- ticker - this is a ticker i made with fake info, but I believe you are using a premade ticker on your beta site
